		              <p>Egypt, country located in the northeastern corner of Africa</p> 
					 <p>Egypt’s heartland, the Nile River valley and delta, was the home of one of the principal civilizations <br> of the ancient Middle East and, like Mesopotamia farther east,<br> was the site of one of the world’s earliest urban and literate societies</p>
					 <p>Pharaonic Egypt thrived for some 3,000 years through a series of native <br> dynasties that were interspersed with brief periods of foreign rule.</p>
